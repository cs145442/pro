## 🔍 Critic Feedback
> 1. Based on the provided diff for the file `docs/errorhandling.rst`, here is the review:

1. **Style Violations (CamelCase vs SnakeCase)**:
   - The content of the diff does not contain any variable names or identifiers that would typically be subject to CamelCase or SnakeCase conventions, as it is primarily documentation text. Therefore, there are no style violations to report in this regard.

2. **License Headers**:
   - The diff does not show any changes to license headers. However, it is important to ensure that the file `docs/errorhandling.rst` includes an appropriate license header at the top of the file, as per the project's guidelines. If the header is missing or incorrect, it should be added or corrected.

3. **Restricted Imports**:
   - The diff does not include any code changes that involve imports, so there are no restricted imports to review in this context. If there are specific guidelines regarding imports in the project, they should be checked in the complete file, but based on the provided diff, there are no issues to report.

Overall, the diff appears to be a straightforward text change without any apparent violations in the areas specified. However, ensure that the license header is present and correct in the full file.

## 🧠 Agent Reasoning (Plan)
- **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan: Pass `AppContext` through Dispatch Methods**
- ---
- ### 1. Update Method Signatures in `Flask` (`src/flask/app.py`)
- - **Change the following methods to accept `ctx: AppContext` as the first parameter:**
-   - `update_template_context`
-   - `handle_http_exception`
-   - `handle_user_exception`

And that's just a small sample of issues you could be facing. So how do we
deal with that sort of problem? By default if your application runs in
production mode, and an exception is raised Flask will display a very simple
page for you and log the exception to the :attr:`~flask.Flask.logger`.
