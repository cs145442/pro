## 🔍 Critic Feedback
> 1. ### Code Review

#### 1. Style Violations (CamelCase vs SnakeCase)
- The code uses CamelCase for class names, which is correct as per Python's naming conventions. However, the attributes defined in the class (e.g., `request_class`, `response_class`, etc.) are in snake_case, which is also correct. There are no style violations in this regard.

#### 2. License Headers
- The provided code does not include any license header. It is essential to include a license header at the top of the file to comply with licensing requirements. A typical license header might look like this:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
#
# Copyright (c) [Year] [Your Name or Company]
# All rights reserved.
#
# This source code is licensed under the MIT License.
# See the LICENSE file in the root directory for details.
```

- Ensure that the license header is added to the top of the file.

#### 3. Restricted Imports
- The code does not show any import statements, so it is not possible to evaluate whether there are any restricted imports. Ensure that any imports comply with the project's guidelines regarding allowed libraries and modules. If there are specific libraries that are restricted, they should not be imported in this file.

### Summary
- **Style Violations**: None found.
- **License Headers**: Missing; add a proper license header at the top of the file.
- **Restricted Imports**: Not applicable as no imports are shown; verify compliance with import guidelines. 

Please address the missing license header and ensure that any imports comply with project standards.

## 🧠 Agent Reasoning (Plan)
- ## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
- ### 1. Update Method Signatures in Flask
- - **Goal:** Change the signatures of the listed dispatch methods in `Flask` to accept `ctx: AppContext` as the first parameter.
- - **Methods to update:**
-   - `update_template_context`
-   - `handle_http_exception`
-   - `handle_user_exception`
-   - `handle_exception`
-   - `log_exception`

class Flask(App):
    """The flask object implements a WSGI application and acts as the central
    object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the
    application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for
    the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.

    The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the
    package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the
    package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with
    a ``__init__.py`` file inside) or a standard module (just a ``.py`` file).
