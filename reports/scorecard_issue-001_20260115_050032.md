## 🔍 Critic Feedback
> 1. Here’s a review of the provided diff based on the specified criteria:

### 1. Style Violations (CamelCase vs SnakeCase)
- The project name is referred to as "Project Name" in CamelCase throughout the documentation. If the project's naming convention is to use SnakeCase (e.g., `project_name`), then this should be updated consistently across all documents. 
- The file names in the diff (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `usage.md`, `faq.md`) are in SnakeCase, which is consistent. However, ensure that the project name in the content matches the naming convention used in the file names.

### 2. License Headers
- There are no license headers present in any of the files modified in this diff. It is generally a good practice to include a license header at the top of each source file to indicate the licensing terms under which the code is distributed. If this project requires a specific license header, it should be added to each file.

### 3. Restricted Imports
- The diff does not include any code files, so there are no imports to review for restrictions. If there are specific libraries or modules that are restricted from being imported in the project, ensure that any code files (not shown in this diff) adhere to those restrictions.

### Summary
- **Style Violations**: Check for consistency in naming conventions (CamelCase vs SnakeCase).
- **License Headers**: Add appropriate license headers to all modified files.
- **Restricted Imports**: No code files were included in the diff, so no review of imports was possible.

Make sure to address these points to ensure compliance with the project's coding standards and guidelines.
