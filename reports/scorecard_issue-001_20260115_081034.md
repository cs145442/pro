## 🔍 Critic Feedback
> 1. Here’s a review of the provided diff based on the specified criteria:

### 1. Style Violations (CamelCase vs SnakeCase)
- The code appears to follow the PEP 8 style guide for naming conventions. The function names (`wsgi_app` and `__call__`) are in snake_case, which is appropriate for Python. There are no CamelCase violations in the provided code.

### 2. License Headers
- There are no license headers present in the provided code snippet. It is important to include a license header at the top of the file to comply with licensing requirements. Ensure that the appropriate license header is added according to the project's guidelines.

### 3. Restricted Imports
- The import statement `from .ctx import AppContext` is present in both versions of the code. There is no indication in the provided diff that this import is restricted. However, it is essential to verify that `AppContext` is not part of a restricted module or library as per the project's policies. If there are specific restrictions on imports, they should be checked against the project's documentation or guidelines.

### Additional Notes
- The use of `# noqa: B001` in the exception handling block is acceptable if the intention is to suppress a specific linting error. However, it is advisable to document why this suppression is necessary to maintain code clarity.
- The overall structure and indentation of the code appear to be consistent and follow standard Python practices.

### Summary
- **Style Violations**: None found.
- **License Headers**: Missing; should be added.
- **Restricted Imports**: No violations noted, but verify against project policies.

Make sure to address the missing license header and confirm the status of the import in relation to any restrictions.

## 🧠 Agent Reasoning (Plan)
- **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan: Pass `AppContext` through Dispatch Methods**
- ---
- ### 1. Update Method Signatures in `Flask` and Related Classes
- **Goal:** Change the signatures of the listed dispatch methods to accept `ctx: AppContext` as the first parameter.
- **Methods to update:**
- - `update_template_context`
